# Tuples assignment

Write a function called skip_tuples.
It has a tuple as input. 
It returns a new tuple as output, 
such as every second element of the input tuple is skipped, 
starting with the first one. 

Example:

The input tuple is('I', 'am', 'a', 'test', 'tuple')

This will return the tuple ('I', 'a', 'tuple').

Don’t forget to write a 
"""
docstring
"""
for the above function.

Put your testcases in main()

# Plagiarism 

Below are rules of thumb that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. 

  

## Reasonable 

Communicating with classmates about assessments and properly citing those discussions. 

Discussing the course’s material with others to understand it better. 

Helping a classmate identify a bug in their code, as by viewing, compiling, or running their code after you have submitted that portion of the assignment yourself. 

Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned work and that you cite the lines’ origins. 

Using third-party AI-based software (including ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, the new Bing, et al.) to suggest snippets of code or to fix bugs, provided that you cite the codes’ origins. 

Sending or showing code that you’ve written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that they might help you identify and fix a bug. 

Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course’s own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to assigned work. 

Whiteboarding solutions with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code. 

Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you. 




## Not Reasonable 

Using third-party AI-based software (including ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, the new Bing, et al.) to generate code without citation. 

Using third-party AI-based software to generate code that you later submit but you cannot explain how the code works. 

Accessing a solution to some assessment prior to (re-)submitting your own. 

Asking a classmate to see their solution to some assessment before (re-)submitting your own. 

Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course’s own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy’s other constraints. 

Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to an assessment when it is they, and not you, who is struggling to solve it. 

Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own. 

Providing or making available solutions to assessments to anyone, whether a past, present, or prospective future student. 

Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to assessments online or elsewhere. 

Splitting an assessment’s workload with another individual and combining your work. 

Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein. 

Viewing another’s solution to an assessment and basing your own solution on it.
