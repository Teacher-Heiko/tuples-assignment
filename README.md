# tuples-assignment

Write a function called skip_tuples.
It has a tuple as input. 
It returns a new tuple as output, 
such as every second element of the input tuple is skipped, 
starting with the first one. 

Example:

The input tuple is('I', 'am', 'a', 'test', 'tuple')

This will return the tuple ('I', 'a', 'tuple').

Donâ€™t forget to write a docstring for the above function.

Put your testcases in main()
